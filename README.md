## ðŸŽ¾ About The Project:
In the `Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue` project, we'll dive into product data for an online sports clothing company with the final goal of developing recommendations for the company to maximize its revenue.  
We will deal with a wide variety of information kept in several tables. The information includes prices, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic.  
We're going to answer questions like:  
- How do the price points of Nike and Adidas products differ?
- Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?
- Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews? And if so, how strong is it?
- Does the length of a product's description influence a product's rating and reviews?
- Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?
- How much of the company's stock consists of footwear items? What is the median revenue generated by these products?
- How does footwear's median revenue differ from clothing products?  

## ðŸ’» Languagues & Tools:  
- `PostgreSQL`: We'll need to apply advanced SQL skills such as aggregation, summarizing, truncating, cleaning, labeling, casting, common table expressions, correlation, and working with dates and times.
- `Power BI`: After cleaning, manipulating & exploring data, we'll visualize data by Power BI tool.

## ðŸ“Š Data Set:
This project is based on <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/optimizing_online_revenue/guided/SQL">Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue</a> Project of DataCamp & I also adjusted some values to have more chances to play around with SQL statements.
