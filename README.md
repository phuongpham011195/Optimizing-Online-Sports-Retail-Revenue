<h1 align="center"> Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue
  
## üéæ About The Project:
In the `Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue` project, we'll dive into product data for an online sports clothing company with the final goal of developing recommendations for the company to maximize its revenue.  
We will deal with a wide variety of information kept in several tables. The information includes prices, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic.  
We're going to answer questions like:  
- How do the price points of Nike and Adidas products differ?
- Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?
- Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews? And if so, how strong is it?
- Does the length of a product's description influence a product's rating and reviews?
- Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?
- How much of the company's stock consists of footwear items? What is the median revenue generated by these products?
- How does footwear's median revenue differ from clothing products?

## üìâ Data Set:
This project is based on <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/optimizing_online_revenue/guided/SQL">Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue</a> Project of DataCamp & I also adjusted some values to have more chances to play around with SQL statements.
Data set includes 5 tables: `info`, `finance`, `traffic`, `brands` and `reviews`.

## üíª Languagues & Tools:  
- `PostgreSQL`: We'll need to apply advanced SQL skills such as aggregation, summarizing, truncating, cleaning, labeling, casting, common table expressions, correlation, and working with dates and times.
- `Power BI`: After cleaning, manipulating & exploring data, we'll visualize data by Power BI tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Function:
SQL functions that I used in this project:
- Create table and import data from csv files
- Create temporate table
- Join functions
- Data Manipulation with CASE Expression, ILIKE operator, UPPER() function
- Aggregate functions with GROUP BY Statement, HAVING clause
- Window functions with RANK() funtion
- CTE (Common Table Expression)
- Pivot table with CROSSTAB query
- Subqueries in SELECT and Where Statement

## üí≠ Recommendation:
- Revenue and customers's reviews have a moderately positive correlation. To improve revenue performance, we should propose some incentive promotions that make customers leave a review after placing an order and try products.
- Product reviews are highest in the first quarter of the calendar year. To optimize costs, we should launch incentive promotions in the other nine months instead of the first quarter.
Nike did a good job when there were no discounts on their products, retaining 100% of their organic customers. However, to expand our customer base, we should add some discounts on some specific products.
- Less product choice is another limitation; more items to choose from can increase revenue.
- Adidas is the top brand by multiple choice of products and a lot of attractive discounts. Another thing we should care about is costs. We should decrease the discount percent to save costs.
- Following the analysis, we can see that if the product does not have a description, the rating will be lower than if it had a clearly stated description. So we must add all the information thoroughly to our online store.
